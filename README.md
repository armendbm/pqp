# pqp - Post-Quantum Privacy
_A command-line program functioning similarly to GnuPG or any implementation of the OpenPGP standard, but which uses post-quantum methods for public-key cryptography._
## Business Model
  * Selling exceptions to the license (discussed below) to companies that would like to develop proprietary software above pqp.
  * Possibly offering support for software use as a subscription-based service
## License
pqp is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later, but exceptions in the form of proprietary licenses are regularly sold to companies wanting to
use the software. This framework was chosen to guarantee the developers of pqp a source of income, but allow the software to be free (libre) to all users.
